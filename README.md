# Linear_Equation_Solver
This is a C++ project, where the user can solve a family of linear equations, with the answer being displayed in decimals

**>Step 1: Enter the number of variables:( the program can take upto 511 variables which is better than most of the resources made available on the internet)**

Here is another example of a family of linear equation of 4 variables

w + x - 3y + z = 2

-5w + 3x - 4y + z = 0

w + x + 2y - z = 1

w + 2x - 4y + 5z = 12
